_"the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing"_

<!-- more -->

Jim Collins introduces _"The Hedgehog Concept"_ in his excellent 2001 book: [_Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't_](http://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html). The concept is based on an essay by Isaiah Berlin entitled [_"The Hedgehog and the Fox"_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox)[^1].

[^1]: Itself based on a poem by the Ancient Greek poet [Archilochus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archilochus).

In Berlin's essay, he subdivides writers and thinkers into two camps: hedgehogs, who see the world based on a single large defining idea and foxes, who draw on a larger set of experiences and for whom the world cannot be reduced to a single idea[^2].

[^2]: [See Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox)

Collins references the essay as a jump off point to introduce the nature of a hedgehog as a preferable metaphore for how "great" companies find success. The concept is modeled as the intersection in Venn diagram of three areas: what you're deeply passionate about, what you can be the **best** in the world at, and finally what drives your economic engine[^3].

[^3]: What you can be the most well-paid for what you do. Basically, what you do that pays you the most.

I've been thinking a lot about this concept recently. Specifically, how it might be applied not to a company as a whole but to a development organization or even to team within a larger development organization within a company. At work we've done a lot to decentralize code; forming new teams around functionality that should be pulled out into separate services and empowering people and teams to control their lifecycles and backlogs. This has been successful in allowing individual teams to innovate and to a large extent own their release cycles.

What has been less successful is the splintering of information and the increase in the need for communication between ever more teams. I think we do a good job of expressing high-level focus for our organization within the larger development organization. 

So what does this concept look like for a team?

I think it looks like this.
