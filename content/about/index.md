I am a [Principal](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-principal-engineer-anyway-douglas-w-arcuri/)-level Software Engineer located in San Francisco, CA. I have many years of experience specializing in Distributed Systems, Platform Infrastructure, API Design & Frameworks, and Open Source Software. I pride myself on mentorship and I get a great sense of accomplishment from helping others realize they belong.

I was born and raised in New Orleans, LA and kept moving west to attend college at Rice University in Houston, TX to eventually settling in San Francisco, CA. I have two wonderful daughters who constantly help to re-invent my world every day.
