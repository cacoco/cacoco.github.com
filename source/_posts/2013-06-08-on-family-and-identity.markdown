(part 1)

In December of 2010 my now wife and I traveled to her hometown of Tunis, Tunisia to spend Christmas with her family. We stayed for about 12 days flying out on January 4, 2011. That happened to be the day a fruit vendor from [Sidi Bouzid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Bouzid) succumbed to his self-inflicted wounds and died.  

He had set himself on fire.

In the fall of 2010 a series of classified memos and communiqués from the US State department became public via the site Wikileaks. It had been all over the press with the talking heads hysterical over the information leaked about America's positions in Afghanistan and Iraq. What was little covered were the pages and pages of information about the ruling family of Tunisia.  

Talking with friends of my wife's family, everyone wanted to speak to me about WikiLeaks. Specifically, they wanted to know if I had read the passages about [Ben Ali, or his wife, or his son](http://middleeast.about.com/b/2011/01/14/tunisias-and-ben-alis-corruptions-the-wikileaks-revelations.htm). The questions weren't merely asked as gossip but with frustration. People were angry.

I met my wife in the San Francisco Bay Area. She was finishing her ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley at the time. She had grown up in Tunis -- the daughter of an American woman from Long Island, NY and a Tunisian man. Her parents met in the early seventies in Paris when her mother was studying abroad. It was a classic love story. Boy meets girl in Paris. Girl finishes college, moves back to Paris to be with boy and eventually settles in Tunis with boy to raise a family.

Driving around the capital of Tunis was a comically frustrating affair. The constant fear of being stopped by police who would be seeking a bribe. Anatomy of the shakedown: the cops would stop you for no clear reason then demand that you "buy a calendar". If you refused, they would write you a ticket or worse haul you in to the station. My wife's family had grown used to this and would stubbornly resist, saying, "go ahead, write me a ticket". The key being that writing a ticket required official paperwork that almost no cop wanted to do. Especially if they just wanted to get money out of you.  

I grew up in New Orleans, LA. Most people only know one thing about my hometown; that it's the home of _Mardi Gras_. I used to tell people when they asked _"What is New Orleans like?"_ That everything there is coated in a __thin film of failure__. This was laid bare by Hurrican Katrina. For all of it's failings, I do miss my home.  

My initial impression of Tunis, the capital of Tunisia was that it was similar to New Orleans. People making due with what they have as best they could. 

Even with the expected police activity things that Christmas were odd. We were stopped more often than usual. One of my wife's American cousins and his (six-foot) readhead wife and I were driving around the capital. We were lost. Luckily, she was driving and spoke French. After one too-many turns through a round-about we were stopped by a police officer. As it turns out, we were very near the Presidential compound. After exchanging paperwork and some words, he let us go.  

Later that evening, we were having dinner with my wife's sister and her fiancé along with a few of their friends. It was a qauint place near the Mediterrean. Fresh seafood. After dinner when we walked back to the car we could see a polic roadblock set-up nearby. We made sure to note to try to avoid it. Sadly, we drove right into it. The cops had set up such that all the streets ended up funneling you right into them. They pulled my wife's sister's fiancé out of the car. They asked for everyone's National ID card. They told him that I was American -- they wanted my passport. I refused. Unfortunately, my wife's sister's fiancé had forgotten his ID card. He had left it in another coat. They told him to get out of the car.

This is a punishable offence.  

The officer began to threaten him with jail time. My wife's sister's fiancé is a great guy. He's genial and loves people. He tries to smooth-talk the officer. The officer began accusing him of being drunk (he wasn't) and said that he'd drag him into the station. My wife's sister got out of car. I got out of the car. I was immediately instructed in Arabic to get back into the car. To me, it seemed that they didn't want the American to see what was going on.

A heated conversation ensued in a mix of French and Arabic as my wife's sister's fiancé has a cigarette with the officer. My wife's sister slips the cop some money -- actually, a lot of money. The heated discussion dies down and they both get back into the car. We drive off and I could tell everyone was shaken as they relayed to me what had happened. My French is horrible and my Arabic non-existent. The officer has accused my wife's sister's fiancé of being drunk and said that he would take him to jail. He asked if he had done his military service yet (another common bullying tactic). The cop was adamant that he was going to take him to the station. Unless...

Later on that evening, I remember talking with my wife as she lay in bed. Her fists were clenched and tears at the corners of her eyes. Her breathing was slow but ragged as though a heavy weight laid on her chest. She was angry at the oppressiveness. Angry at the feeling of helplessness. "This is why I hate this place," she said.

My wife's second sister was 6 months pregnant with her second child at the time. She lives in Tunis with her husband and daughter. They rent an apartment near the water where we could walk out and stare onto the Mediterranean. My wife's sister's husband once joked that he thought he was marrying an "exotic" American woman. The joke is that she's more "Tunisian" than most Tunisian woman.

I joked to my wife that I thought I was marrying an "exotic" Tunisian woman. At times she's more "American" than I am.

What will our kids be?

During a hectic NYE party at the household of some friends I was cornered by many asking my thoughts on the Wikileaks revelations. At first I thought they were wondering about the conversation we were having in the states about our secrets being aired, how bad it was, if this was condemnable, etc. What they actually wanted to know if anyone in the states cared about the juicy Tunisian gossip. Like the fact that the president's son had an island fortress complete with Tigers for entertainment. Everyone knew things were outrageous -- they just never knew how much[^1]. And when they found out they were apoplectic. I had to admit, that it wasn't much of a conversation in the states. We didn't really think about Tunisia. Hell, half the people I talk to about where my wife is from pause, then ask "Tunisia...where is that, again?" A small country that I feel at times is mirrored in the small stature of my wife that just didn't register in the national conversation in the United States.

That would change.

We had heard whisperings of protests in the southern part of the country but no one talked of anything specific. So it wasn't all that surprising when the news came that President Ben Ali would be giving a televised speech, though it was unsual. The President was not known for his speeches. Typically, public speeches are given in more traditional (formal sounding) Arabic (the language of the Qu'ran -- as opposed to Tunisian Arabic) and Ben Ali's wasn't great. This was appointment TV. My wife and her family huddled around the television as the speech began. The President appeared sitting behind a large desk; to his left was a telephone. His speech began. Of course, I understood none of it and got bits and pieces translated to me by the family. One part in particular invited lots of snickers. Turns out the President had said that he respected the people's voice and the right of free-speach (no one really believed this) but that "those who wished to create discord would be punished."

Then the telephone on his desk began to rang.

We started to look around at each other. Was this really happening? Maybe it wasn't the phone on the desk that was ringing, maybe it was a phone just off-screen. Ben Ali continued as if he had not heard anything. It kept ringing. And ringing. We knew Ben Ali could hear it. We started to laugh. We started joking that someone was really trying to reach the President to let him know that he speech wasn't going well. That the people weren't buying it. That maybe his formal Arabic wasn't really being understood.

We didn't know what to make of the event. But it started to dawn on us that something big was going on if he felt the need to go in front of the coutnry to address the situation.

It was a day or so after we landed back in that states when we heard that Mohamed Bouazizi[^3] had died from his wounds.

A few months later in March my wife's sister gave birth to a bouncing baby boy. A child of post-revolution Tunisia. What the country will ultimately become will depend on he and his older sister and all the other children of Tunisia. The future is theirs just as the country is now the people's. Things are chaotic, but the world has moved on.
