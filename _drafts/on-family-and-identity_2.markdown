###Part 2

In December of 2012 my wife and I -- now officially married -- traveled back to her hometown of [Tunis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis), Tunisia to visit her family for the holidays. I had not been back since the revolution engulfed the country, the president ousted and a new Islamist government elected into power.

Things had changed.

My wife had travelled back during Christmas of 2011 but I had stayed in the states to see my family in Charlotte, NC. In July of 2012 we were married in a small family-mostly ceremony on [Frazer Point](http://www.acadiamagic.com/schoodic/frazer-point.htm) on the [Schoodic Pennisula](http://www.acadia.ws/schoodic.htm)[^1] in Maine part of the Acadia National Park.

In September of 2012 just days following the attack of the US Embassy in Benghazi, Libya which resulted in the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens as well as 3 others[^2] the US Embassy in Tunisia along with the neighboring American school were attacked, vandalized, and set on fire[^3] resulting in the death of two persons.

My wife graduated from Princeton in 1998. Her freshman year she met a friend during freshman orientation who while they hadn't remained close ended up in the foreign service serving in Tunisia. My wife received and email from her in early 2012 catching up and reminiscing and letting her know that she had landed of all places in Tunis and that the next time my wife was in town that they should get together.

She was in the compound on September 14, 2012 when it was attacked.

We ended up talking with her during a Christmas party she was throwing while we were in town.

US Ambassador, guards, tense-ness.
"new normal" of relationship now with expectation of violence.

One year later after the attack.

Even after all of this time, little pilfered money has been recovered[^4].

We return in June of 2013 for my wife's second sister's wedding. Feelings of frustration that it is the ceremony that my wife does not get since she married me, an American. That she has somehow been cheated out of part of her culture due to her father's anger and ignorance and a country in upheaval. If we could have had a ceremony in Tunis -- I would have gladly done it.
